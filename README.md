Hello, welcome to my portfolio page.
Here's the link to the deployed website: https://portfolio-davidpraise-njinus-projects.vercel.app/

This is a review of all that went into making it as well as features incorporated into it.

TECHNOLOGOIES USED
1. HTML & CSS: I used HTML 5 for the structure and CSS for styling , and BOOTSTRAP CSS & Animate CSS for animations and smooth scrolling
2. JAVASCRIPT: Here,I used vanilla javascript for the functionality, especially for the buttons and also for smooth scrolling.
3. FORMSPREE: I used formspree to connect the contact form to my email so that I can be receiving emails from it.
4. VERCEL: Vercel was used for production and deployment.
6. AI TOOLS: I used the following AI tools during development:
  -Loveable AI:
  I  used this to make a very rough template for the HTML ,CSS and Javascript files. I had a very busy schedule and couldn't find enough time to code everything from scratch, but I had the designs and color scheme already chosen.
  -Deepseek AI:
  This tool helped me to overcome problems I faced during deployment using the terminal.
  -Chatgpt:
  It helped me to learn how formspree works and how I can manually connect and configure it.
  Blackbox AI:
  It helped me understand the errors I was facing during development.

FEATURES IMPLEMENTED
First, before we delve into the features.I want to say that this is a multiple page website, and I know it would have been easier to create a single page website, 
but I was more comfortable with it that way , plus this gives me a chance in the future to grow the pages' content , and specialize it.

Here's the features:
1. Sliding cards animation in The about and project features:It makes the pages a bit entertaining to the user, enhancing user experience.
2. Previews for the about and projects page in the home page: This is for the users who might not have much time to go through every page, it allows them to get information they can use to make a choice.
3. Neo-futuristic colors:I just liked them.
4. Call to action buttons on the landing page.

Disclaimer:
I do not have any projects published, so the live demo buttons are all linked to non-existing pages but are working, and the view code buttons are linked to my github page.
